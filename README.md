Functionality:
This program generates a list of numbers translated from decimal (base 10) to any other base number. Decimals are even included (and it looks as messy as it sounds), but nothing under 1.

History:
This idea of different base numbers other than 10 or 2 came to my some time ago, so I decided to make a Python program out of it. Then, to practice my website building skills, I decided to convert the program into a viewable and working wbepage. It's quite a simple site but it helped me get a better understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS than any tutorial hell could.

-Base Number Counter function in JS (done 8/13)
