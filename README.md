Base Number Counter

This program intends to count from a given minimum number and maximum number in a given number base, such as base 10 (Normal numbers) or base 2 (binary numbers).

Currently I am translating this code over to javascript and make a simple website out of it. 

TODO:
-Base Number Counter function in JS (done 8/13)
